# Quantum-Information-Theory

### Notes that I have taken throughout my undergraduate class, hoping to give people a place to get the information about the subject without having to take a whole class.

- This latex document is an introduction to quantum information theory including examples and proofs to aid in comprehension. 
- By the end of the semester this document will provide a good overarching introduction to the fast changing and interesting topic of quantum computing and information transmission.  
- Hopefully this document translates many of the confusing math concepts into easier to understand abstractions and high level visualizations, so the crazy mathematicians don't scare away someone interested in the subject.  

*Big thank you to Dr. Hamidi for the Latex template with many really cool macros, it made development so much easier, also big thank you to Dr. Hamidi and Dr. Ismert for teaching the class, and spending hours upon hours helping me through the class and structuring the class to make it interersting and fun.*
