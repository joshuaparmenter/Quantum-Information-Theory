# Quantum-Information-Theory

### Notes that I have taken throughout my undergraduate class, hoping to give people a place to get the information about the subject without having to take a whole class.

This latex document is an introduction to quantum information theory including examples and proofs, by the end of the semester this will be a good overarching introduction to the fast changing and interesting topic of quantum computing and information transmission.  Hopefully translating many of the confusing math concepts into easier to understand abstractions and high level visualizations, so the crazy mathematicians don't scare away someone interested in the subject.
