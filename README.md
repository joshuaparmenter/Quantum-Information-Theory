# Quantum-Information-Theory

### Notes that I have taken throughout my undergraduate class, hoping to give people a place to get the information about the subject without having to take a whole class.

A latex document that is an introduction to quantum information theory including examples and proofs, by the end of the semester this will be a good overarching introduction to the fast changing and interesting topic of quantum computing and information transmission.
